        <h4>Your 22<sup>nd</sup> Birthday</h4>
        <p>
          Dear Ashley, <br><br>
          Happy Birthday! Today, I just want to take a moment to express how much you mean to me. 
          It’s hard to put into words just how grateful I am to have you in my life. 
          You’ve been my rock, my confidant, and my biggest cheerleader. Every memory we’ve shared has been a testament 
          to our beautiful friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
          From our adventures to our heart-to-heart talks, you’ve always been my sunshine. 
          On this special day, I wish you all the happiness, love, and success you deserve.
        </p>

        <h1>Who’s that<br>girl?</h1>
        <p>
          Ashley is one of the kindest, most genuine, and radiant people you’ll ever meet. 
          Her smile lights up any room she walks into, and her laugh is simply contagious.  
          She’s 22 years young, ambitious, and full of love.  
          Her heart is as beautiful as her spirit — she brings warmth, joy, and light wherever she goes.  
          Her friends adore her and everyone who meets her can’t help but feel inspired.
          She would quite literally do anything for her bestfriends, and her ability to be
          so caring to her friends and family is something everyone admires
